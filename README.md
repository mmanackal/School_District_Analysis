# School_District_Analysis

## Overview of the school district analysis
The purpose of this project was to help Maria analyze high school data within a school district. Maria asked us to look at the type of school (charter vs district), the amount of funding per student, and student math & reading scores.
Right when we had completed our data analysis, we learned that there is evidence of academic dishonesty among 9th graders at Thomas High School. Their grades had been altered and we had to go back and place and NaN for their grades and re-run the analysis.
 
## Results
###How is the district summary affected?
With the 9th graders taken out, we can see clearly that the Charter School passing percentages for math and reading went down. Thomas High School was a charter school.

###How is the school summary affected?
The overall passing percentage for Thomas High School went down as well after we ran the data again. THS had an overall passing rate of 90% and went down to 65% after the 9th graders were removed.

###How does replacing the ninth graders’ math and reading scores affect Thomas High School’s performance relative to the other schools?
Thomas High School's performance went down which can be seen in the images above.

####How does replacing the ninth-grade scores affect the following:
- Math and reading scores by grade
- Scores by school spending
- Scores by school size
- Scores by school type

Math and reading scores by grade
Math and reading passing % for 9th grade would go down. The average passing percentages for schools grouped by size, type, and spending ranges that Thomas High school would fall under will all decrease. 

## Summary
One of the pain points of this analysis was performing an analysis as new data was provided. It felt as though we were never finished and just when we thought we were, we had to re-run everything due to evidence of academic dishonesty.
Aside from this, I feel our team provided a lot of good information for Maria and the district leaders. The data shows that Charter school students performing better in math, reading, and overall passing compared to the district school, with the exception of Thomas High School.
It would be good to look into what these schools are doing to prepare their students and take some of those tips to the district schools. Hopefully a deep dive into their practices does surface more academic dishonesty concerns. Surprisingly, more spending dollars per student
doesn't correlate to better performance. Thomas high school students should be re-tested in a highly monitored environment and the new results should be added to the analysis. For a school, its important to know where their students are academically in order to update teaching
practices as needed.
